With hands-on experience in building robust web applications using React.js, Node.js, and Python, and a solid foundation in PostgreSQL and CI/CD practices, my skill set aligns directly with the key responsibilities of this role.\n\nIn my recent experience, I have developed end-to-end solutions that mirror your requirements. For example, I engineered a full-stack Note-Taking App using Next.js, Node.js, and a PostgreSQL database, where I was responsible for designing the database schema and implementing RESTful APIs. Additionally, as a Volunteer Software Developer, I collaborated in an Agile environment to build responsive front-end features with React and write integration tests using Jest, contributing directly to application reliability and our CI/CD pipeline.\n\nMy proficiency with Git, along with a commitment to writing clean, maintainable code, has been central to my work. I am a collaborative problem-solver with a fullstack mindset, eager to contribute to your team’s projects and grow my expertise in a fast-paced environment. I am confident I can help your team deliver high-quality features that meet business requirements.\n\nThank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to discuss how my background in fullstack development can benefit your team and look forward to hearing from you."
